# Black Friday Sales Prediction

# Overview
This project aims to predict Black Friday sales using machine learning models. It combines data analysis, visualization in Tableau, and predictive modeling in a Python notebook to gain insights and create a regression model for sales prediction.
    
# Tableau Workbook
The Tableau workbook (Black_Friday_Sales_Prediction.twb) includes various visualizations and insights generated from the Black Friday sales data. It presents trends, patterns, and analysis of sales data.

# Python Notebook
The Python notebook (Black_Friday_Sales_Prediction.ipynb) contains code for predictive modeling. It explores the dataset, preprocesses data, creates regression models, and evaluates their performance for Black Friday sales prediction.
